title: Bring iPhone Simulator in Front

When I do some *build and run* via Xcode, sometimes the **Simulator** stuck at the back of IDE and it needs to be click manually in order to show. In this script, it will bring the simulator in front every time you build and run your project. **Very convenient** for Simulator Users. ðŸ˜‰

Steps: **Xcode > Project > Build Phases > Targets > New Run**
