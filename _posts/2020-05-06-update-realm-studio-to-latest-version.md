If you encounter this error, it seems that you have outdated Realm Studio like me. Maybe you download it somewhere specially from outdated guides via Internet. Similar case which I get a very low version ```Version 3.10.0```. Prior to latest version of Realm Studio today, it jumps to ```Version 10.0.1``` which is very far from my Version that I have.

This guide will help you to check or put the latest Realm Studio in your Mac.
