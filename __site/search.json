      "content"  : "Information is probably the single most addictive substance, even more so than heroin in it can give you the kick even before you have consumed it, let alone waiting for the system to digest it. And what is more interesting is, the quality and the content(in chemist-speak, the composition, and the dosage) that is required to stimulate an individual varies for each individual. For some, the effect kicks in at ‚Äúkeeping up with Kardashians‚Äù; for some, when reading editorials in the economist or the new yorker; and for some, reading self-help claptrap disguised as psychology and science. Whichever end of the spectrum you are in there is not much difference in the effect it has on you ‚Äì all it does is, it consumes your senses.\n\nThe problem is no one puts up a disclaimer about whether or not it is fit for you to consume. You have to figure it out yourself. And what is all the more disconcerting is the fact that in doing so none of us are aware of the toll it has taken on us. Consider a simple case of skimming through a newspaper(or an online news app if you are tech-savvy), how much do you retain at the end of it? So, at what point is the trade war between the US and China right now? Oh, and what is happening in the US open? Who is the current world champion in blitz-chess? What happened to the bridge that was going to be built in the who-cares where region? And then top it with some political and investment news, you have successfully deceived yourself into believing that you have hoarded all the information you could and retained nothing. I emphasize nothing!\n\nIf you were to explain the article to someone say a couple days later, I bet all you could recall is the headline. This is the plight of pretty much everyone right now. The toll taken on our attention span due to this continuous influx of information outweighs most of the benefits of consuming it. You travel up the ladder in wealth and status this becomes far graver ‚Äì you can see people competing for information, meaning, one might not like politics at all but they are now forced to hold an opinion on the president and the current affairs just to be able to contribute to verbal diarrhea to be a part of the social group and to keep up the ostensible progress.\n\nNow consider this, you read a New York Times piece on Venezuela‚Äôs economic collapse that states socialist policies as the primary reason, the high it can give you is indescribable, you suddenly are anti-‚Äúthis‚Äù and pro-‚Äúsomething else‚Äù. If someone asked you your political views, you are now nothing more than a parrot regurgitating a New York Times piece as a reason for your anti-socialism stance. Okay, I am sorry I understand that citing only one article can show one in a bad light, so maybe a bunch of them?\n\nNote: Before we go any further, I must clarify that anything that is not explicitly stated by me as my own view should not be extrapolated from the examples or the writing style.\n\nIt is precisely because of this indolent nature of our brain that I ask you to be careful. At least in the case of occupational hazards, you are aware of the downsides, and when you do sign up you do it wittingly. But in the case of Informational Hazards, neither are we aware of the downsides nor did we sign up for it knowingly.\n\nFurthermore, the indispensable problem that is concomitant of free inflow of information is: [[preference falsification::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preference_falsification]]. For reasons I don‚Äôt understand, it seems like the more the information you accumulate the more are you prone to hiding your true preferences. One theory I have is you think you have to be broad-minded at the expense of your natural instincts but what I don‚Äôt understand is how come such smart people who learn to be broad-minded do not understand the cascading effects of the palatable lie. How difficult is it to realize that this lie if prolonged could become the new truth. Is that what we want?\n\nOur brains have this funny little characteristic or I should say side-effect of generating biases; and when you provide them their favorite fodder a.k.a information, it not only triggers the center of knowledge, it switches on the neighboring center for bias generation too. One that I can instantly recall is that of our collective bias due to the exposure to apparent progress in terms of iPads and iPhones, all of us are made to think that the field of science and technology is evolving at a rapid pace but if you dig deeper there hasn‚Äôt been any fundamental breakthrough in the area of pure sciences since the late 1970s, which marked the invention of semiconductors. Eric Weinstein, mathematician and economist speaks about this in great detail in one of his [[podcasts::https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM9f0W2KD5s]] on stagnation in science and technology with Peter Thiel. (Do check it out)\n\nIt is not for me to tell what to read and what not to, but I what do know is, there is a mental threshold to what one can make sense of. I have spoken about this in detail in one of my previous essays on the [[branching effects of higher-order thinking::https://raghuveer.net/posts/branching-effects-of-higher-order-thinking/]]. Sometimes, the mental fatigue is real, and in such cases, unnecessary consumption can have undesired effects. So the next time you read about how quantum computers use superposition to surpass conventional computers in representing bits and their states in a newspaper column or a blog post, please try to explain it your kids before you convince yourself of the apparently profound knowledge that you just acquired. Oh yeah, and please don‚Äôt draw any conclusions before you explain it to them.\n\nThis is a subtle topic, and there are a million ways to look at it. From why it is really important in this day and age to be updated to how you might not satisfy all the system requirements for the update. To be honest, most of us do not have spec required to hold the information and use it. And there are no good developers around to fix the bugs i.e., the biases and mental fatigue. I think it is good to have your own guiding heuristic as to what do you want to consume and what you don‚Äôt. Pick your sources, moderate your intake, and always ponder on it before jumping to conclusions."

      "title"    : "Introduction to Simply Jekyll",
      "url"      : "/posts/Introduction-to-simply-jekyll",
      "content"  : "Simply Jekyll is a highly functional jekyll-based theme that combines the best of different worlds (atleast tries to üòÖ). It is a minimal and distraction free theme that strives to provide maximum value all without holding back on any essential features that a user would benefit from or would desire for. This is an evolving project and is garanteed to be maintained at least for quite some time as I myself am a beneficiary of this theme and the project.\n\nThe theme provides a rich set of features that include:\n\n  Wiki-style markdown syntax for both internal as well as external links.\n  Support for backlinks and related posts to exhort serendipitous encounters.\n  Feed-specific context menu for instantly accessing the related posts and references.\n  Auto stale-link management for internal links.\n  Custom syntax for sidenotes and marginnotes on either side of the feed/post.\n  Support for partial transclusion of posts.\n  On hover page preview.\n  Custom classes to style phrasing elements like quotes, callouts, etc by mentioning size, font-types, weight, box etc.\n  Preliminary support for flashcards.\n  Custom syntax to highlight your favorite part of the post (No, I am not talking about code syntax highlighting, which is already provided by Jekyll through Rouge).\n  Support for external link identifier through icons.\n  Finally, the most important of them all ‚Äî No bloatware or frameworks!\n\n\nPlus everything else that you can already do with jekyll like write something on a bunch of markdown files and convert it into a HTML file or sprinkle in some inline html can still be done alongside these features.\n\nNeat stuff, isn't it? To see the above mentioned features in action go check out the next post. :P\n\nAlso see the sample post‚Äî[[(Sample Essay) Informational Hazard - Thinking Before Consuming]]‚Äîto get a feel for how an actual essay would look like. :)"

      "title"    : "Exploring the features of Simply Jekyll",
      "url"      : "/posts/Exploring-the-features-of-simply-jekyll",
      "content"  : "Essentiality is the heart of any good software, and this theme is designed to ensure that I don't add things that I won't use on a daily basis or not have things that would be important for my personal usecase. It has been designed carefully to get rid of all  the feature creeps, bloatwares, etc. i.e., no bootstrap, no semantic, no jquery, no nothing‚Ä¶\n\nThat said, this is a ready made theme and I am making it public so that more number of people will use it and enjoy the experience of using it. So, pardon my bigotry thereüòÖ.\n\nAs for the list of features, this website steals features from every website that I can think of, or more appropriately the design inspiration for this website is derived from multiple sources; Here is the tiny list for the curious:\n\n\n  Backlinks:  Roam Research\n  Transclusion:  Tiddlywiki\n  Sidenote:  Edward Tufte, Gwern Branwen\n  Stale Link Highlighting: Tiddlywiki\n  Wiki-style links:  Every wiki ever\n  Text highlighting:  Roam Research\n  Page preview:  Wikipedia\n  Context menu:  Google Docs\n  Notes:  Andy Matuschak's Evergreen Notes\n  Color scheme: Github\n  Feed like structure for home page:  Twitter\n  Omnisearch box at the top:  Google\n  Profile board:  Twitter/Instagram\n\n\nNow that you know all my secrets let us not waste any more time into further exposing my true nature in its entirety and get started with tour:P\n\nNote: This page only showcases the features. How to use these feature is mentioned in a separate article.\n\nBacklinks\n\nBacklinks or as Roam Research calls it \"Birdirectional Links\" is a nifty little feature that allows not only users reading your essays/articles to encounter interesting related articles, this is something you as a author yourself will see how powerful it is once you start browsing around your website. Backlinks are basically a link on PostA indicating all the mentions of PostA on different Posts.\n\nThe neat stuff is it won't show up with an empty box if a given post doesn't have any backlinks and if it is already included in backlinks, it won't show up in your related posts[[Related Posts: Posts that share same tag(s). Linked References(Backlinks): Posts that link other posts inside your blog.::rmn]]. :)\n\nHere is a screenshot of what mentions/backlinks will look like in a page:\n\n\n\nIn the above example, it can be seen that there are three links, it means that all the three pages have a link to the page in which they are being displayed as a backlink.\n\nFor eg. If you scroll all the way to the bottom, you will something similar i.e., you will see a link to the pages that has a link to this page.\n\nSidenotes and Marginnotes\n\nOf what use are such wide margins when you can't make efficient use of them. Fear not, we have a way to handle that too ‚Äî Marginnotes[[There are two types of people, those who have taste and those who don't. And anyone who has even a tiny bit of taste will never, never-ever use footnotes over sidenotes.‚ÄîSome random blogger who shall remain unamed::rmn]]. For what it's worth, when you stroll down a garden, you don't ever see a flower bloom 10 miles away from the plant do you? This is where sidenotes come in and replace their paper-era sibling ie., footnotes. If it is relevant you see it right there. (No scrolling = No cognitive strain). The entire idea is to allow users to have a pleasant time on your blog i.e., Not too distracting(offputting), not too mesmerizing, just the right amount of ornamentation to allow seamless reading experience[[I see it as an issue of managing &amp; exposing the length. Some readers want to go as deep as you can take them, but others are frustrated if you block them from moving on. I deal with it by use of collapsible sections+abstracts, margin notes, and explicit topics in list items.‚ÄîTweet by Gwern Branwen::lsn]]. The added advantage we have with this website is it has wide margins allowing us to use both sides for sidenotes. So we can use them for quotations, small snippets, and also for interactive/expository animations.\n\nThe first one on the right is a marginnote and the second one on the left is a sidenote. You may ask what is the difference, it looks all the same to me. You are right to some extent, but if you look closely you will see that the one on left has a number attached to it while the one on the right doesn't. Yes, that is all the difference there is, at least [[Edward Tufte::https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/]] says.\n\nOn-feed context menu\n\nContext menus are a great way to improve user experience if they are done correctly. Given that our theme has a feed-link structure for the landing page, it leverages the opportunity and saves second time visitors who have already read the article and are only here to see other related articles or the backlinks by just simply right clicking on the feed. Thereby saving users the unnecessay time involved with clicking on a link and scrolling all the way down to see the backlinks or related articles.\n\nHere is a screenshot for people who are too lazy, while the rest of you can go back to the home page and try it out by right clicking on a particular feed entry:\n\n\n\n\nOn-hover page preview\n\nEver been to a blog or a tutorial site and seen links to other pages without any clue as to what that page is about apart from vague statements like \"See Related\" or \"Click here for Part II\". We all have had that experience, haven't we? Wouldn't it be nice to be able to take a cursory glance at the page just so that you could get a feel of it and decide quickly as to whether or not do you really want to read that post without having to click on the link and wait for the ginormous scroll of text to load? That is precisely what page previews are for. For eg, try to hover over this link: [[Serendipity Based outlook as a driver for large Scale personal projects]].\n\nAnd yes, all of what you see is available right out of the box. No configuration, no sh*t, no shinola.\n\nTransclusion\n\nOnce I had sidenotes and page preview for my blog, transclusion[[Serendipity Based outlook as a driver for large Scale personal projects::rmn-transclude]] just felt like the natural next step to it. I mean there are less important pages that you can leave at the discretion of the readers to hover-over and take a peak, and then there are pages that you want to explicity show a glimpse of, but how do you do it? Obviously, putting a chunk of random text in the most of your post is just unacceptable UX, but then how else do you do  it? You could just combine the nifty little preview thingy with your nice little sidenote thingy and let users get a glimpse of the important stuff without getting distracted. Amazing, isn't it?\n\nLink Management\n\nNow the biggest of them all: the permalink curse. Most of us are never happy with the first title that we come up with, and when you excitingly write a new post embedding an old post‚Äîthe title of which you always wanted to change but never got time to do so because you were busy creating content‚Äîit sometimes happens that you forget to update the relevant link all the associated places that you linked it in. And I think this is worst of them all in terms of an UX nightmare.\n\nAlthough we don't have a complete solution given that we are using a static site generator, I think we have a decent mechanism to atleast find the culprit links without clicking at them (a.k.a highlighting links that don't point anywhere, but ideally must be pointing to some location due to which they cannot be deleted).\n\nHere is an example of:\n\n  A perfectly valid link: [[Comparison based on accomplishment does not have a baseline]]\n  A bad link that does not point anywhere: [[Some non-existing title]]\n\n\nSee how it highlights in yellow? I feel this is a game-changer that anyone who has a personal website should at least think of incorporating in their website given the number of deadlink issues we face.\n\nNote: This only works with local/internal links.\n\nMiscellaneous Features: Highlighting text, Primitive Flash Cards, and Some gimmicks\n\nText Highlighting\n\nSo you are writing an essay and you want to emphasize a particular portion of your essay to your audience that you think is just mindblowing. Tools like Medium provide such an easy way to do this while we still keep scratching our head with mark tags and p tag with a background color and what not.. Worry not, this theme allows you to easily highlight a portion of a text without any hassle.\n\nHere is an example of it:\n\n\"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, [[quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident::highlight]], sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.\"\n\nPrimitive Flashcards\n\nAnki has been my friend, my well-wisher, my guardian, pretty much everything for the last one year of my intellectual life. I have a half-hour morning routine that I follow dilligently in going through the scheduled anki decks to strengthen my neuronal connection on a particular topic/subject. And I have been doing it consistently for almost a year now. This is an attempt at recreating the aspect of spaced-repetition to allow my brain to form interesting connections based on things I have already written. The plan is to extend it using local storage and somekind of firebase like service to provide a constant reminder to users using the supermemo algorithm, but as of now, this is where I stand ‚Äî a simple on-click card to keep the thing going until I build something better.\n\nHere is an example(click on the card):\n\n\"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, [[consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor::srs]] incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.\"\n\nFor all you know, this could be used for some interesting things if you have a tutorials website where you write posts on technical concepts. So that's that.\n\nThe Gimmicks\n\nProfile Board for Main Site\n\nIf you have ever used a social media with feeds you probably have stalked the profiles of people you find interesting, but the problem is as much as the mystery gets someone into look at your profile, it also makes them form opinions. If the profile reads author, you see their feed one way; and if it says scientist from Caltech, you see it the other. I mean as much as authority is a thing to form opinions about, it also alienates people from what could potentially have been a great relation if not for the credentiality and appearance. So, the idea with the profile board was to get done with this stuff right away so that people can enjoy the content instead of going profile hunting on your credibility and accomplishments and appearances to judge and validate their opinions by validating you.\n\nHere is the screenshot:\n\n\n\nOmnisearch bar\n\nThis is inspired by the browsers like Chrome and Firefox where the searchbar is always placed at the top so that readers can easily search for the next thing without having to go back to the main page and scroll through dozens of articles.\n\nAnd I personally like this one because, it allows me as an author/writer to quickly jump between different posts while I am reading my articles to reference in my other articles.\n\nHere is a screenshot:\n\n\n\nNote: The searchbar is not implemented as a scrollspying widget that pins itself automatically is because I have a preference for distraction free content when reading, that is why the website provides a chevron to scroll to the top easily instead of pinning the search to the header.\n\nFeed-like structure\n\nI am a big fan of Aza Raskin's infinite scroll design and the fact that it provides such an easy way to engage users is just mind-blowing. That said, I must also confess that I am not a big fan of infinite scrolls on social media websites given their addictive nature. Blogs are fundamentally finite in nature. I mean even if you are a highly productive individual who writes a thousand page essay a day, you would have only written 365 essays and not all of them interesting to me. So having a feed-like structure on blogs I feel is fundamental to allowing users to engage in a more neutral way.\n\nAnd if you are still not sure of its utility, go join twitter or facebook or instagram, and comeback to read this again after a month or so.\n\nUntill then here is the screenshot:\n\n\n\nAuto-tagging WIP posts on the feed\n\nSometimes you are writing something interesting but have not completed the entire thing, lets say like a series of posts on single, it can be helpful to show users right away on the feed/homepage the status so that when they click the post, their expectations are already managed.\n\nHere is a screenshot.\n\n\n\nClickable tags\n\nIf you go the posts on the homepage, and go inside any of them and try to click on the tags such as date or category, you will see that it takes you to a page with all the posts belonging to that tag or date. Just a nifty little feature.\n\nAnd that is all! Thanks for scrolling all the way through to see all the features.

      "content"  : "This is going to be a super simple post about how to setup and use this theme for your own website.\n\nUsage\n\nQ. What will it look like when I am done setting it up?\n\n\n  This is what it should look  (minus the exact essays ofcourse):\n\n\n\nNow without further ado, let's get started!\n\nSetup Prerequisites\n\nFor this tutorial, we‚Äôll need to install a few things on your machine (you may have some of these already). Following the instructions on each website to install them.\n\n\n  [[Ruby::https://www.ruby-lang.org/]]\n  [[RubyGems::https://rubygems.org/]]\n  [[Git::https://git-scm.com/downloads]]\n\n\nYou‚Äôll also need to create accounts on the following services:\n\n\n  [[GitHub::https://www.github.com/join]] (to store the website)\n  [[Netlify::https://app.netlify.com/signup]] (to serve the website so others can see)\n\n\nOnce you are all set with the prerequisites, we can then get to the fun part of getting it to appear on your screen. Let's get started with that.\n\n1. Create a fork of the template repository\n\nTo simplify things, I provide the template showed in the image above to get started. You can always tweak this template to your taste later.\n\nVisit the GitHub page for my template repository ([[raghuveerdotnet/jekyll-seamless::https://github.com/raghuveerdotnet/jekyll-seamless]]), and fork it to your account using the Fork button:\n\n\n  \n\n\nOnce the forking process is complete, you should have a fork (essentially a copy) of my template in your own GitHub account. On the GitHub page for your repository, click on the green ‚ÄúClone or download‚Äù button, and copy the URL: we‚Äôll need it for the next step.\n\n2. Clone your repository locally\n\nNext, we want to download the files from your GitHub repository onto your local machine. To do this, replace  in the command below with the URL you copied in the previous step, then execute this command:\n\n$ git clone &lt;YOUR_COPIED_URL_HERE&gt; my-personal-website\n\n\nAs a reference point, this is how it looks like for me (the difference is likely just the GitHub username):\n\n$ git clone git@github.com:raghuveerdotnet/jekyll-seamless.git my-personal-website\n\n\nThen, navigate into the directory that was just created:\n\n$ cd my-personal-website\n\n\n3. Test out the site locally\n\nSweet! You now have your repository‚Äôs source code on your machine. Within the my-personal-website directory, run the following command to install the necessary dependencies like Jekyll:\n\n$ bundle\n\n\nOnce that‚Äôs done, ask Jekyll to start serving the site locally:\n\n$ bundle exec jekyll serve\n\n\nThen, open up [[http://localhost:4000::http://localhost:4000]] in your browser.\n\nIf everything‚Äôs done correctly, you should now see the home page of your Personal Jekyll Website with Simply Jekyll Theme. üéâ\n\nKeep in mind that this site is only available locally (notice the localhost part of the URL), so if we want it to be available on the Internet for everyone to enjoy, we need to deploy it to the Internet: we‚Äôll use Netlify for that in the next step.\n\n4. Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify\n\nNetlify lets you automatically deploy your personal website on to the Internet when you update your GitHub repository. To do this, we need to connect your GitHub repository to Netlify:\n\n\n  Log in to Netlify\n  Once logged in, click the ‚ÄúNew site from Git‚Äù button\n  On the next page, select GitHub as the continuous deployment provider (you may need to authorize the connection, in which case, approve it)\n  On the next page, select your website repository from the list.\n  On the next page, replace the basic build settings with the following.\n    \n      Type in \"jekyll build\" (without the quotes) inside the text field titled \"Build Command\".\n      Similarly type in \"_site/\" (without the quotes) inside the text field titled \"Publish Directory\".\n    \n  \n  On the next page, keep the default settings, and click on ‚ÄúDeploy site‚Äù.\n\n\nThat was easy! We‚Äôre almost done.\n\nWait a couple of minutes for the initial deploy to complete.\n\nOnce that‚Äôs done, your website should be available on the Internet via a generic Netlify URL, which you can change to a custom domain later if you‚Äôd like.\n\nNow the cool thing is this: whenever you push an update to your GitHub repository, Netlify will automatically deploy your updates to the Internet.\n\n5. Start producing content with your Simply Jekyll based Website\n\nAt this point, you can start updating the files on your machine (in the my-personal-website folder) to change your jekyll seamless based website to your liking: update the copy, add some notes, tweak the layout, customize the colors, etc. Once you have something you‚Äôre happy with, push your changes to your GitHub repository with the following commands:\n\n$ git add --all\n$ git commit -m 'Update content'\n$ git push origin master\n\n\nIf that command succeeds and the rest of the tutorial was done correctly, in a couple of minutes, you should see your changes live on your Netlify website. üöÄ\n\nAnd we‚Äôre done! You now have your own Simply Jekyll based Personal Website .\n\n\n\nIf you‚Äôre curious, take a look at [[my personal jekyll seamless based website here::https://www.raghuveer.net]].\n\nThis setup tutorial is inspired by [[Maxime Vaillancourt::https://maximevaillancourt.com]]'s Digital Garden Tutorial."

      "content"  : "Welcome to this feature usage tour. This is going to be another short post that describes how to use all the fancy features we saw in [[Exploring the features of Simply Jekyll]]. So without further ado, let's get started.\n\nThe default features\n\nAll the default jekyll markdown features are made available such that they don't cause any conflict with the custom features that we have implemented. To see how to the raw markdown gets generated, go to the [[Test page to see how the raw markdown is rendered]]\n\nThe Custom features\n\n1. Creating a wiki-style link\n\nGeneral Syntax\n\n\n  \n    Internal links: [‚Äã[‚ÄãSome Link]]\n  \n  \n    External links: [‚Äã[‚ÄãSome Text::https://address-to-the-website]]\n  \n\n\nAnything text inside a double square bracket is considered as an internal link. The text has to be a valid title, if you provide a random text inside double square brackets, it will showup highlighted in yellow telling you that there is no essay/article/file with the mentioned title.\n\nSimilarly, for external links all you have to do is add a double colon after the \"Alt text\" and enter the link to the website after the double colon as seen below.\n\nExamples\n\nExample of an internal link that points to a valid post or page, that is, a page with the title (not url) mentioned in the double brackets.\n\n\n  Raw Syntax: [‚Äã[‚ÄãComparison based on accomplishment does not have a baseline]]\n\n  Rendered Text: [[Comparison based on accomplishment does not have a baseline]]\n\n\nExample of an internal link that do not point to a valid post or page, that is, a page with the title (not url) mentioned in the double brackets.\n\n\n  Raw Syntax: [‚Äã[Title of a non-existent page]]\n\n  Rendered Text: [[Title of a non-existent page]]\n\n\n2. Creating a sidenote or a marginnote\n\nGeneral Syntax\n\n\n  \n    Sidenote: [‚Äã[Some Text::keyword-of-the-type-of-the-sidenote]]\n  \n  \n    Marginnote: [‚Äã[‚ÄãSome Text::keyword-of-the-type-of-the-marginnote]]\n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        Type of the sidenote/marginnote\n        keyword\n      \n    \n    \n      \n        Left Sidenote\n        lsn\n      \n      \n        Right Sidenote\n        rsn\n      \n      \n        Left Marginnote\n        lmn\n      \n      \n        Right Marginnote\n        rmn\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nSo, all you have to do is type in the keywords of the corresponding type of sidenote or marginnote after the double colon in the above syntax\n\nExamples\n\nExample of a sidenote to the right side of the page:\n\n\n  Raw Syntax: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

Specific classes for changing font-type, font-size, and font-weight\n\nThere are classes like very-small, medium-small, small, small-medium, medium, medium-large, large, very-large; that can be used to change the size of your text directly from markdown like this:\n\n\n  Raw Syntax:\n  {:.large}\nSome text here that needs to be enlarged\n  \n\n  Rendered Text:\n\n  Some text here that needs to be enlarged\n\n\nSimilarly there are classes like regular-sans, serif, bold, italic, oblique, bolder, etc for formatting the text.\n\n\n  Raw Syntax:\n\n  {:.medium .serif .oblique}\nSome text here that needs to be enlarged\n  \n\n  Rendered Text:\n\n  Some text here that needs to be enlarged\n\n\nOther common classes are .boxit that is used to wrap the text, .disable-user-select to disallow users from being able to select a particular piece of text by selecting it, etc. There are more classes like these which you can see in the file style.css. Once you figure out which class to use, all you have to do is just add the class before the text you want inside a curl brace like this ‚Äã{:&lt;classnames-with-dot-prepended-to-them&gt;‚Äã}\n\n8. Other implicit features.\n\nFeatures like backlinks, context menu, related posts, page preview are available by default as they are implemented using CSS and JS. So, you don't have to do anything other than write as you would normally to make use of those features.\n\nNote:\nWhen you typeout square brackets, it can be frustrating to type out the entire file title everytime. At least it was for me, so I created a small VSCode plugin, the editor in which I write my essays to autocomplete the titles as soon as I type double squarebrackets. It has been pretty handy for me, if you are interested in using VSCode or already use it, you can find it here: [[Notecomplete::https://github.com/raghuveerdotnet/scratchpad/tree/master/note-complete]]. It is pretty simple to use, all you have to do is just download the note-complete folder and copy it to .vscode directory in your OS to start using it. :)\n\nFor setting up the theme on your website checkout [[How to setup Simply Jekyll]]"

However, many renderers ‚Äì like Github's and Markdown Here ‚Äì support syntax highlighting. Which languages are supported and how those language names should be written will vary from renderer to renderer. Markdown Here supports highlighting for dozens of languages (and not-really-languages, like diffs and HTTP headers);\n\nInline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.\n\n\nInline code has back-ticks around it.\n\nBlocks of code are either fenced by lines with three back-ticks ```, or are indented with four spaces. I recommend only using the fenced code blocks ‚Äì they're easier and only they support syntax highlighting.\n\n\n\n```javascript\nvar s = \"JavaScript syntax highlighting\";\nalert(s);\n```\n\n```python\ns = \"Python syntax highlighting\"\nprint s\n```\n\n```\nNo language indicated, so no syntax highlighting.\nBut let's throw in a tag.\n```\n\n\n\nvar s = \"JavaScript syntax highlighting\";\nalert(s);\n\n\ns = \"Python syntax highlighting\"\nprint s\n\n\nNo language indicated, so no syntax highlighting.\nBut let's throw in a &lt;b&gt;tag&lt;/b&gt;.\n\n\nMath expressions\n\n\nYou can write math expressions using the \\(\\LateX\\) markup language between double dollar signs : $$‚Ä¶$$. They can be written inline or as a single block.\n\nFor example,\n\n\n  \n    \n      $$P(A\n      B) = \\frac{P(B\n      A)\\cdot P(A)}{P(B)}$$ will render as :\n    \n  \n\n\n\\[P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B | A)\\cdot P(A)}{P(B)}\\]\n\n\n  \n    \n      Please note that for a math block to be displayed correctly, it needs to be separated by an empty line, above and below. Besides, the pipe character\n      may conflict with markdown : it is recommended to use \\vert instead.\n    \n  \n\n\nTables\n\n\nTables aren't part of the core Markdown spec, but they are part of GFM and Markdown Here supports them. They are an easy way of adding tables to your email ‚Äì a task that would otherwise require copy-pasting from another application.\n\nColons can be used to align columns.\n\n| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |\n| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|\n| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |\n| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |\n| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |\n\nThere must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.\nThe outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the\nraw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.\n\nMarkdown | Less | Pretty\n--- | --- | ---\n*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**\n1 | 2 | 3\n\n\nColons can be used to align columns.\n\n\n  \n    \n      Tables\n      Are\n      Cool\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      col 3 is\n      right-aligned\n      $1600\n    \n    \n      col 2 is\n      centered\n      $12\n    \n    \n      zebra stripes\n      are neat\n      $1\n    \n  \n\n\nThere must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.\nThe outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the\nraw Markdown line up prettily.

Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone.

You'll soon learn to get what you want. \"Markdown Toggle\" is your friend.\n\nHere are some things to try out:\n\nHere's a line for us to start with.\n\nThis line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a *separate paragraph*.\n\nThis line is also a separate paragraph, but...\nThis line is only separated by a single newline, so it's a separate line in the *same paragraph*.\n\n\nHere's a line for us to start with.\n\nThis line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a separate paragraph.\n\nThis line is also a separate paragraph, but‚Ä¶\nThis line is only separated by a single newline, so it's a separate line in the same paragraph.\n\nLicense: CC-BY"

However, I was a New Yorker for a whole year in 1930‚Äì 31 while attending advertising classes in Columbia‚Äôs School of Business. Actually I am a southerner, from Mississippi, the nation‚Äôs most backward state. Ramifications include Walter H. Page, who, unluckily for me, is no longer connected with Doubleday-Page, which is no longer Doubleday-Page, even. I have a B.A. (‚Äô 29) from the University of Wisconsin, where I majored in English without a care in the world. For the last eighteen months I was languishing in my own office in a radio station in Jackson, Miss., writing continuities, dramas, mule feed advertisements, santa claus talks, and life insurance playlets; now I have given that up‚Ä¶.The witty use of what I like to call a socio-cultural confabulation in the form of a movie review and a relatable but madeup word that is also original in a sense.  ‚Ä¶As to what I might do for you‚Äî I have seen an untoward amount of picture galleries and 15¬¢ movies lately, and could review them with my old prosperous detachment, I think; in fact, I recently coined a general word for Matisse‚Äôs pictures after seeing his latest at the Marie Harriman: concubineapple. That shows you how my mind works‚Äîquick, and away from the point. I read simply voraciously, and can drum up an opinion afterwards‚Ä¶The mention of India print and subtle showcase of how she knows the struggles in the industry without any explicit mention.  ‚Ä¶Since I have bought an India print, and a large number of phonograph records from a Mr. Nussbaum who picks them up, and a Cezanne Bathers one inch long (that shows you I read e. e. cummings I hope), I am anxious to have an apartment, not to mention a small portable phonograph. How I would like to work for you! A little paragraph each morning‚Äî a little paragraph each night, if you can‚Äôt hire me from daylight to dark, although I would work like a slave. I can also draw like Mr. Thurber, in case he goes off the deep end. I have studied flower painting‚Ä¶And the final invocation of the extremely common social contruct i.e., the leprechaun throw.  There is no telling where I may apply, if you turn me down; I realize this will not phase you, but consider my other alternative: the U of N.C. offers for $12.00 to let me dance in Vachel Lindsay‚Äôs Congo. I congo on. I rest my case, repeating that I am a hard worker.This may not have been the best application in a formal sense, but the reason people go to it is probably because what it reminds them of ‚Äî the cultural nostalgia (the shared social artefact).Another type of common artefact is sincere immitation of great works, the sincere admiration can help with the remembrance. Related: [[Sincere imitation is authentic]]AddendumIncorporation of common artefacts might also help with remebering and understanding it easily when you read them years later.

My experience has been that when I have had a bad last night sleep or stress due to office, I invariably am looking for less polarity, otherwise the dark on white seems more appealing to me both aesthetics wise and legibility wise. An extension of these could be that cognitive stress elevate the ocular stress like accomodative/refractive/convergence stress leading up to this, but I contest dark mode being the wide-spread personal/subjective preference.ReferencesBauer, D., &amp; Cavonius, C., R. (1980). Improving the legibility of visual display units through contrast reversal.(From: [[UX Stackexchange on theme and eye strain::https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/53264/dark-or-white-color-theme-is-better-for-the-eyes]])  \"‚Ä¶However, most studies have shown that dark characters on a light background are superior to light characters on a dark background (when the refresh rate is fairly high). For example, Bauer and Cavonius (1980) found that participants were 26% more accurate in reading text when they read it with dark characters on a light background‚Ä¶\"Pabini Gabriel-Petit. (2007). [[Applying color theory to digital displays::https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2007/01/applying-color-theory-to-digital-displays.php]]  \"‚Ä¶While white text on a black background provides very high value contrast, it is less readable and causes greater eye fatigue than black text on a white background‚Ä¶\"Jason Harrison ‚Äì Post Doctoral Fellow, Imager Lab Manager ‚Äì Sensory Perception and Interaction Research Group, University of British Columbia  People with astigmatism (approximately 50% of the population) find it harder to read white text on black than black text on white. Part of this has to do with light levels: with a bright display (white background) the iris closes a bit more, decreasing the effect of the \"deformed\" lens; with a dark display (black background) the iris opens to receive more light and the deformation of the lens creates a much fuzzier focus at the eye.Raluca Budiu.

      "content"  : "To improve as a programmer, every programmer whether working independently or in an organization should atleast have one project that they control 100% of, and it doesn't matter if it is your main project or a side project. When you are working for an organization or working independently on a collaborative oss, the major chunk of your cognitive bandwidth gets allocated to those projects, which is not bad per-se, it does teach you how to work in a collaborative environment and to learn from people who are better at the concerned technology/concept than you. But the issue is more personal and emotional in when you are working on something bigger than you, it unwittingly causes a self-effacive effect i.e., you tend to devalue the emotional effects of being able to create something with complete autonomy, or crave for the autonomy and burnout as a result of the cognitive exhaustion. The sense of freedom and the liberating experience that comes out of the creative autonomy is just unmatched.Even a side-project in github that you consider to be trivial has an effect that only such kind of projects can provide, of having done everything yourself and without anyone putting constraints on what you can and what you can't. It allows you to experiment outside of what would be acceptable within a project you are doing with others. Something like what if I just re-wrote this entire engine on top of openGL would never (or almost never) make sense in a collaborative project, but it would make perfect sense if it is just you.The other obvious advantage is it makes you much more light-hearted because you know that if this doesn't work out the way I like it or good for me, then I can just go. When you are working on a personal project out of your own free will, it has a certain kind of air that a collaborative project won't. It is purely voluntary, and you can just up and leave at any time. That adds something to the mix. The responsibility of joy or stress that comes out of it suddenly becomes more tolerable as well as enjoyable.  Note that I am not advocating that you drop everything that you don't like, it is just that having certain things in your life that you can control can help handle that which you can't.Related: [[Creativity is a quality without a name]]ReferencesAndreas Kling.

This is based on the idea by Kurzban et. al that overcommiting to a task, that is only expected to show its result in distant future, can dissolve will power to an extent of a burnout or complete unproductivity. And in my opinion, it not just affects the quantifiable components, it also affects your qualitative components like creative autonomy.After talking with few interesting people and trying out various different processes myself I have come to the conclusion that some of the strategies mentioned below can help in persistance of motivation in a long term personal project without any unnatural self-enforced adherence.
