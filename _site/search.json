Think about a trigger when you push to specific branch and do a Bitrise task on it. You need to check again to Bitrise Web in order to see the result of that task.\n\nThis step adds a flavor in your Bitrise Workflow, and better to put it at the end of all of your steps. It will send notification to your Telegram after finishing the Bitrise Task.\n\nExample:\n\n  push to develop branch\n  Sit down or do some other task and wait for your phone to notify the build from Bitrise.\n\n\nSteps:\n\n  Choose any of your workflow to put the Telegram Notification to be included at the end of it.\n\n\n\n\n\n  Click the + button at the end and search for send telegram message.\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n\nThere are four required input variables in this telegram step which are;\n$TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN (SENSITIVE)\n$TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID (SENSITIVE)\n$DOWNLOAD_URL\n$CUSTOM_MESSAGE\n\nENV Details:\nTELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN - Your Bot Token.\n\nTELEGRAM_CHAT_ID - Your Telegram Account Chat ID.\n\nDOWNLOAD_URL - Environment if you want to Download your archive.\n\nCUSTOM_MESSAGE - Depending on what you want to show in telegram bot.\n\n\n\n  After that, search for BotFather in Telegram search bar.\n  For $TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN , you can follow my convo with him.\n\n\n\n\n\n  For $TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID , search for @get_id_bot in Telegram search bar.\n    /start\n/my_id"

      "content"  : "I have this problem in my Production Scheme when someone user crashes their app and\nthe dSYM's are not uploaded in our Firebase. It seems that it needs a bit of work to do in order to upload the dYSM's.\nBased on the guide provided by Firebase, there are two ways to upload the dYSM's. First is to include script before build the iOS Projects and second is to do it manually. What I did is to do it manually by doing some minimal bash commands.\n\nThese are my mostly used BASH commands.\nls\nls -l\ncd *folder name\ncd ~\ncd ..\n\n\nFor the steps:\n\n  First, navigate to Appstore Connect and choose your app\n  Go to Activity Tab &gt; Latest Version &gt; Include Symbol &gt; download dSYM\n  Put it on Desktop to easy reference\n  Go here https://firebase.google.com/docs/crashlytics/get-deobfuscated-reports?platform=ios\n  Check Upload your dSYM Topic\n\n\nThese are the Placeholders\ndSYM_directory = the dSYM zip that you've downloaded in appstoreconnect\n$PODS_ROOT/FirebaseCrashlytics/upload-symbols = the firebase upload-symbols in the current project\n\n  You can get this by creating a script in Build Phases and add script \"echo $PODS_ROOT/FirebaseCrashlytics/upload-symbols\"\n  After building, navigate to Report Navigator in the left of xcode and click the first hammer icon. Scroll down at the bottom and you will find the current directory of $PODS_ROOT\n  /path/to/GoogleService-Info.plist = you can also get the path of this using the steps above\nplatform = ios\n\n\nNOTE: Login in firebase cli first before executing this script\n\n# BASH\nfirebase login\nfirebase projects:list # To check the projects, for verification\n\n\nFirst Script:\n\nfind dSYM_directory -name \"*.dSYM\" | xargs -I \\{\\} $PODS_ROOT/FirebaseCrashlytics/upload-symbols -gsp /path/to/GoogleService-Info.plist -p platform \\{\\}\n\n\nSecond Script:\n\n/path/to/pods/directory/FirebaseCrashlytics/upload-symbols -gsp /path/to/GoogleService-Info.plist -p ios /path/to/dSYMs\n\n\nI used second script and shows success on my Terminal but the Firebase still reflects the warning. Maybe it works or maybe not.\n\n\nPS: It works!. If we manually upload the dSYM before this image below occurs, the error alert will still remain, but the following errors will not produce error alert anymore and the future errors it will process by the Firebase/Crashlytics.\n\n\nBetter to have a script when we archive the project. It must automatically upload the dSYM into Crashlytics. Possible solutions would be putting a script in Xcode after the building of Production Builld or automate it via CI/CD Bitrise."
