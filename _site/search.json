      "url"      : "/posts/migrating-from-xcode11-to-12",
      "content"  : "When Apple introduced Big Sur with adapting their own built-in processor, which is the Apple M1 for their upcoming Macbook variants, my working project faced some problems regarding on migration from Xcode11 to Xcode12. It took me few days to figure out what happened and the reasons why the latest Xcode was failing.\n\n\n\nInitial findings were firstly, Xcode12 supports the arm architecture that disabled way back old versions of Xcode. Xcode Simulator runs in x86_64 architecture Intel because the default processor used by Apple was Intel. Since they're shifting to arm, Xcode12 included the arm architecture in Simulator. When I shifted to Xcode12, it compiled to arm64 instead of x86_64 Intel. Xcode12 must detect that i'm using Intel processor and the project must compile in x86_64 architecture, but forces it to compile in arm64. While doing random stuff, I tried to create a new project using latest Xcode12 to check if the problem will come out with my fresh installed Xcode12 since it can't detect my current Macbook Intel, but the result was different from my project built in Xcode11. The new project can detect my current processor Intel and it compiled by using x86_47 which is right. This means that some of the projects built in Xcode11 may face some problem same as mine. Secondly, Xcode12 deprecate the VALID_ARCHS option in project build settings that can be seen in Xcode11 and shifts into ONLY_ACTIVE_ARCH (Build Active Architecture Only) for Xcode12. This might be another problem on why the project failed. Based on some information that I've read, Build Active Architecture Only is an option to choose what architecture will Xcode integrate in the project. It either automatically adapt what target architecture will be used or make it manual based on the Valid Architecture indicated in the Project Settings. I tried to use the yes option in Build Active Architecture Only but still there's an error popping out even when I set it to all of my schemes, so I tried the no option, and put the VALID_ARCHS manually. For my manual configuration, I only set two settings for VALID_ARCHS and one for Exclude Architecture.\n\nBuild Active Architecture = no\n\nExcluded Architecture\nAny iOS Simulator SDK = arm64\n\nVALID_ARCHS\nAny iOS Simulator SDK = x86_64\nAny iOS SDK = arm64 armv7s armv7\n\n\nThe reasons why I exclude the arm64 in Any iOS Simulator is that to force the Xcode to avoid compile it as an arm64 because I'm not using Apple M1 chip. To complete the VALID_ARCHS configuration, I include the x86_64 too in the VALID_ARCHS for iOS Simulator which is x86_64. For the the iOS SDK, I include all valid archs for iOS which are arm64 armv7s armv7.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe drawbacks of this configuration is that if someone build it using their Xcode12, it will fail since the default project settings were already modified specially using Xcode 11. It will conflict since the Xcode11 VALID_ARCHS shifts to ONLY_ACTIVE_ARCH for Xcode12. If someone needs to build this project, the first step would be doing a pod install or for totally clean pod build, execute the pod deintegrate first before proceeding to pod install. After that if the user wants to shift to their current projects, they must do the pod deintegrate pod install to revert back their default pod build settings configuration."

      "content"  : "Hello, Good day! gonna share my thoughts about this Unit Test topic. I feel there's somethings wrong, so I look up and explore\nabout it. Looking back of what i'm pointing, I tried to do Unit Test since theres something benefits of creating\nthis test. It makes the code more reliable and bug free since we can do click Unit Test after doing some changes in codebase.\nBut then I have this struggle on how to fully cover unit test in the Project which are UIViewControllers. I can't test them since some of my\nfunction and logics were tightly coupled. It means that in one function there were two or more business logic.\n\nUnit Test via testable import needs a return function in order to test it but since my functions were already coupled, I need to\ndecompose/breaks them into a smaller pieces which I have my own trust issues. I feel there something strange bug will pop out\nelsewhere since I will move some of the business logic from my codebase. So what I did is UI Test, its an actual test on a simulator of physical device, It's somehow resembles in Selenium which automates the action on simulator. We can just click record and do some clicks on simulator, then XCode will provide the action code. That's the one of alternative of testing my codebase since I have this trust\nissues on breaking them down into smaller pieces/functions.\n\nMeanwhile, while reading some stuffs on the internet. I found this feedback which I relate of what he said.\n\n\n\nIn his case, he had this PhotoListViewController with a lot of business logic like converting date, start/stop activity indicator,\nshowing/hiding table view, also with a dependency API Service. He points out its too complicated since there were different kind of\npresentation logic in one file which resembles in my case(MVC), thats why the MVC is also called as Massive View Controller.\n\nBased on my readings there were good solution for this; is to implement a Software Architecture Pattern that implements Presentation/Domain Layer which all business process will be put in here. There are some of Software Architecture Pattern that implements it, the MVP and MVVC are widely know for this that has the Separation of Concern to other layer which gives benefit to implement an extensive Unit Test for every Data/UI component."

It seems that it needs a lot of work to do in order to upload the dYSM's.\nBased on the guide provided by Firebase, there are two ways to upload the dYSM's. First is to include script before build the iOS Projects and second is to do it manually. What I did is to do it manually by doing some minimal bash commands.\n\nThese are my mostly used BASH commands.\nls\nls -l\ncd *folder name\ncd ~\ncd ..\n\n\nFor the steps:\n\n  First, navigate to Appstore Connect and choose your app\n  Go to Activity Tab &gt; Latest Version &gt; Include Symbol &gt; download dSYM\n  Put it on Desktop for easy reference\n  Go here https://firebase.google.com/docs/crashlytics/get-deobfuscated-reports?platform=ios\n  Check Upload your dSYM Topic\n\n\nThese are the Placeholders\ndSYM_directory = the dSYM zip that you've downloaded in appstoreconnect\n$PODS_ROOT/FirebaseCrashlytics/upload-symbols = the firebase upload-symbols in the current project\n\n  You can get this by creating a script in Build Phases and add script \"echo $PODS_ROOT/FirebaseCrashlytics/upload-symbols\"\n  After building, navigate to Report Navigator in the left of xcode and click the first hammer icon. Scroll down at the bottom and you will find the current directory of $PODS_ROOT\n  /path/to/GoogleService-Info.plist = you can also get the path of this using the steps above\nplatform = ios\n\n\nNOTE: Login in firebase cli first before executing this script\n\n# BASH\nfirebase login\nfirebase projects:list # To check the projects, for verification\n\n\nFirst Script:\n\nfind dSYM_directory -name \"*.dSYM\" | xargs -I \\{\\} $PODS_ROOT/FirebaseCrashlytics/upload-symbols -gsp /path/to/GoogleService-Info.plist -p platform \\{\\}\n\n\nSecond Script:\n\n/path/to/pods/directory/FirebaseCrashlytics/upload-symbols -gsp /path/to/GoogleService-Info.plist -p ios /path/to/dSYMs\n\n\n\n\nI used second script and shows success on my Terminal but the Firebase still reflects the warning. Maybe it works or maybe not.\n\n\nPS: It works! If we manually upload the dSYM before this image below occurs, the error alert will still remain, but the following errors will not produce error alert anymore and the future errors it will be preceded and process by the Firebase/Crashlytics.\n\n\nBetter to have a script when we archive the project that automatically uploads the dSYM into Crashlytics. Possible solutions would be putting a script in Xcode after building the Production, or automate it via CI/CD Bitrise."
