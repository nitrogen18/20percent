      "content"  : "Information is probably the single most addictive substance, even more so than heroin in it can give you the kick even before you have consumed it, let alone waiting for the system to digest it. And what is more interesting is, the quality and the content(in chemist-speak, the composition, and the dosage) that is required to stimulate an individual varies for each individual. For some, the effect kicks in at ‚Äúkeeping up with Kardashians‚Äù; for some, when reading editorials in the economist or the new yorker; and for some, reading self-help claptrap disguised as psychology and science. Whichever end of the spectrum you are in there is not much difference in the effect it has on you ‚Äì all it does is, it consumes your senses.\n\nThe problem is no one puts up a disclaimer about whether or not it is fit for you to consume. You have to figure it out yourself. And what is all the more disconcerting is the fact that in doing so none of us are aware of the toll it has taken on us. Consider a simple case of skimming through a newspaper(or an online news app if you are tech-savvy), how much do you retain at the end of it? So, at what point is the trade war between the US and China right now? Oh, and what is happening in the US open? Who is the current world champion in blitz-chess? What happened to the bridge that was going to be built in the who-cares where region? And then top it with some political and investment news, you have successfully deceived yourself into believing that you have hoarded all the information you could and retained nothing. I emphasize nothing!\n\nIf you were to explain the article to someone say a couple days later, I bet all you could recall is the headline. This is the plight of pretty much everyone right now. The toll taken on our attention span due to this continuous influx of information outweighs most of the benefits of consuming it. You travel up the ladder in wealth and status this becomes far graver ‚Äì you can see people competing for information, meaning, one might not like politics at all but they are now forced to hold an opinion on the president and the current affairs just to be able to contribute to verbal diarrhea to be a part of the social group and to keep up the ostensible progress.\n\nNow consider this, you read a New York Times piece on Venezuela‚Äôs economic collapse that states socialist policies as the primary reason, the high it can give you is indescribable, you suddenly are anti-‚Äúthis‚Äù and pro-‚Äúsomething else‚Äù. If someone asked you your political views, you are now nothing more than a parrot regurgitating a New York Times piece as a reason for your anti-socialism stance. Okay, I am sorry I understand that citing only one article can show one in a bad light, so maybe a bunch of them?\n\nNote: Before we go any further, I must clarify that anything that is not explicitly stated by me as my own view should not be extrapolated from the examples or the writing style.\n\nIt is precisely because of this indolent nature of our brain that I ask you to be careful. At least in the case of occupational hazards, you are aware of the downsides, and when you do sign up you do it wittingly. But in the case of Informational Hazards, neither are we aware of the downsides nor did we sign up for it knowingly.\n\nFurthermore, the indispensable problem that is concomitant of free inflow of information is: [[preference falsification::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preference_falsification]]. For reasons I don‚Äôt understand, it seems like the more the information you accumulate the more are you prone to hiding your true preferences. One theory I have is you think you have to be broad-minded at the expense of your natural instincts but what I don‚Äôt understand is how come such smart people who learn to be broad-minded do not understand the cascading effects of the palatable lie. How difficult is it to realize that this lie if prolonged could become the new truth. Is that what we want?\n\nOur brains have this funny little characteristic or I should say side-effect of generating biases; and when you provide them their favorite fodder a.k.a information, it not only triggers the center of knowledge, it switches on the neighboring center for bias generation too. One that I can instantly recall is that of our collective bias due to the exposure to apparent progress in terms of iPads and iPhones, all of us are made to think that the field of science and technology is evolving at a rapid pace but if you dig deeper there hasn‚Äôt been any fundamental breakthrough in the area of pure sciences since the late 1970s, which marked the invention of semiconductors. Eric Weinstein, mathematician and economist speaks about this in great detail in one of his [[podcasts::https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM9f0W2KD5s]] on stagnation in science and technology with Peter Thiel. (Do check it out)\n\nIt is not for me to tell what to read and what not to, but I what do know is, there is a mental threshold to what one can make sense of. I have spoken about this in detail in one of my previous essays on the [[branching effects of higher-order thinking::https://raghuveer.net/posts/branching-effects-of-higher-order-thinking/]]. Sometimes, the mental fatigue is real, and in such cases, unnecessary consumption can have undesired effects. So the next time you read about how quantum computers use superposition to surpass conventional computers in representing bits and their states in a newspaper column or a blog post, please try to explain it your kids before you convince yourself of the apparently profound knowledge that you just acquired. Oh yeah, and please don‚Äôt draw any conclusions before you explain it to them.\n\nThis is a subtle topic, and there are a million ways to look at it. From why it is really important in this day and age to be updated to how you might not satisfy all the system requirements for the update. To be honest, most of us do not have spec required to hold the information and use it. And there are no good developers around to fix the bugs i.e., the biases and mental fatigue. I think it is good to have your own guiding heuristic as to what do you want to consume and what you don‚Äôt. Pick your sources, moderate your intake, and always ponder on it before jumping to conclusions."

It is a minimal and distraction free theme that strives to provide maximum value all without holding back on any essential features that a user would benefit from or would desire for. This is an evolving project and is garanteed to be maintained at least for quite some time as I myself am a beneficiary of this theme and the project.\n\nThe theme provides a rich set of features that include:\n\n  Wiki-style markdown syntax for both internal as well as external links.\n  Support for backlinks and related posts to exhort serendipitous encounters.\n  Feed-specific context menu for instantly accessing the related posts and references.\n  Auto stale-link management for internal links.\n  Custom syntax for sidenotes and marginnotes on either side of the feed/post.\n  Support for partial transclusion of posts.\n  On hover page preview.\n  Custom classes to style phrasing elements like quotes, callouts, etc by mentioning size, font-types, weight, box etc.\n  Preliminary support for flashcards.\n  Custom syntax to highlight your favorite part of the post (No, I am not talking about code syntax highlighting, which is already provided by Jekyll through Rouge).\n  Support for external link identifier through icons.\n  Finally, the most important of them all ‚Äî No bloatware or frameworks!\n\n\nPlus everything else that you can already do with jekyll like write something on a bunch of markdown files and convert it into a HTML file or sprinkle in some inline html can still be done alongside these features.\n\nNeat stuff, isn't it?

However, I was a New Yorker for a whole year in 1930‚Äì 31 while attending advertising classes in Columbia‚Äôs School of Business. Actually I am a southerner, from Mississippi, the nation‚Äôs most backward state. Ramifications include Walter H. Page, who, unluckily for me, is no longer connected with Doubleday-Page, which is no longer Doubleday-Page, even. I have a B.A. (‚Äô 29) from the University of Wisconsin, where I majored in English without a care in the world. For the last eighteen months I was languishing in my own office in a radio station in Jackson, Miss., writing continuities, dramas, mule feed advertisements, santa claus talks, and life insurance playlets; now I have given that up‚Ä¶.The witty use of what I like to call a socio-cultural confabulation in the form of a movie review and a relatable but madeup word that is also original in a sense.  ‚Ä¶As to what I might do for you‚Äî I have seen an untoward amount of picture galleries and 15¬¢ movies lately, and could review them with my old prosperous detachment, I think; in fact, I recently coined a general word for Matisse‚Äôs pictures after seeing his latest at the Marie Harriman: concubineapple. That shows you how my mind works‚Äîquick, and away from the point. I read simply voraciously, and can drum up an opinion afterwards‚Ä¶The mention of India print and subtle showcase of how she knows the struggles in the industry without any explicit mention.  ‚Ä¶Since I have bought an India print, and a large number of phonograph records from a Mr. Nussbaum who picks them up, and a Cezanne Bathers one inch long (that shows you I read e. e. cummings I hope), I am anxious to have an apartment, not to mention a small portable phonograph. How I would like to work for you! A little paragraph each morning‚Äî a little paragraph each night, if you can‚Äôt hire me from daylight to dark, although I would work like a slave. I can also draw like Mr. Thurber, in case he goes off the deep end. I have studied flower painting‚Ä¶And the final invocation of the extremely common social contruct i.e., the leprechaun throw.  There is no telling where I may apply, if you turn me down; I realize this will not phase you, but consider my other alternative: the U of N.C. offers for $12.00 to let me dance in Vachel Lindsay‚Äôs Congo. I congo on. I rest my case, repeating that I am a hard worker.This may not have been the best application in a formal sense, but the reason people go to it is probably because what it reminds them of ‚Äî the cultural nostalgia (the shared social artefact).Another type of common artefact is sincere immitation of great works, the sincere admiration can help with the remembrance.

      "content"  : "Sensitivity to brightness can occur due to number of issues ranging from corneal issues like infections and abrasions, to dry eye, to concussions, to allergies; eg: Keratoconus, Uveitis, Keratitis, Preeclampsia. Google claims in its [[android developer guide that dark themes can improve visibility for people who have low vision and are sensititive to brightness::https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/look-and-feel/darktheme]], but people I have spoken to on this topic (n‚âà20) had normal vision and normal range of sensitivity to light.Even people with mild eye issues[[Jason Harrison, UBC - People with astigmatism (approximately 50% of the population) find it harder to read white text on black than black text on white.::lsn]] seem to benefit from light theme than dark theme in most cases. And to top it all, even the researches that focus on the legibility[[Bauer, D., &amp; Cavonius, C., R. (1980). Improving the legibility of visual display units through contrast reversal. See Below for more.::rsn]] and aesthetics claim that dark on light is almost always better than dark on light. Every article I have read and referenced below vouch for dark on light, which I find to be true too at least in most occasions.How can what is relatively bad for legibility in most ocassions, bad in terms of expressibility of authorial aesthetics be a wide-spread preference? My hypothesis is this is primarily due to cognitive exhaustion like sleep deprivation, burn-out, stress etc (Extrapolating from n=1), which due to implicity conformity and [[preference falsification::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preference_falsification]] has become a normative social element. My experience has been that when I have had a bad last night sleep or stress due to office, I invariably am looking for less polarity, otherwise the dark on white seems more appealing to me both aesthetics wise and legibility wise. An extension of these could be that cognitive stress elevate the ocular stress like accomodative/refractive/convergence stress leading up to this, but I contest dark mode being the wide-spread personal/subjective preference.ReferencesBauer, D., &amp; Cavonius, C., R.

Part of this has to do with light levels: with a bright display (white background) the iris closes a bit more, decreasing the effect of the \"deformed\" lens; with a dark display (black background) the iris opens to receive more light and the deformation of the lens creates a much fuzzier focus at the eye.Raluca Budiu.

      "content"  : "To improve as a programmer, every programmer whether working independently or in an organization should atleast have one project that they control 100% of, and it doesn't matter if it is your main project or a side project. When you are working for an organization or working independently on a collaborative oss, the major chunk of your cognitive bandwidth gets allocated to those projects, which is not bad per-se, it does teach you how to work in a collaborative environment and to learn from people who are better at the concerned technology/concept than you. But the issue is more personal and emotional in when you are working on something bigger than you, it unwittingly causes a self-effacive effect i.e., you tend to devalue the emotional effects of being able to create something with complete autonomy, or crave for the autonomy and burnout as a result of the cognitive exhaustion. The sense of freedom and the liberating experience that comes out of the creative autonomy is just unmatched.Even a side-project in github that you consider to be trivial has an effect that only such kind of projects can provide, of having done everything yourself and without anyone putting constraints on what you can and what you can't. It allows you to experiment outside of what would be acceptable within a project you are doing with others. Something like what if I just re-wrote this entire engine on top of openGL would never (or almost never) make sense in a collaborative project, but it would make perfect sense if it is just you.The other obvious advantage is it makes you much more light-hearted because you know that if this doesn't work out the way I like it or good for me, then I can just go. When you are working on a personal project out of your own free will, it has a certain kind of air that a collaborative project won't. It is purely voluntary, and you can just up and leave at any time. That adds something to the mix. The responsibility of joy or stress that comes out of it suddenly becomes more tolerable as well as enjoyable.  Note that I am not advocating that you drop everything that you don't like, it is just that having certain things in your life that you can control can help handle that which you can't.Related: [[Creativity is a quality without a name]]ReferencesAndreas Kling.

This is based on the idea by Kurzban et. al that overcommiting to a task, that is only expected to show its result in distant future, can dissolve will power to an extent of a burnout or complete unproductivity. And in my opinion, it not just affects the quantifiable components, it also affects your qualitative components like creative autonomy.After talking with few interesting people and trying out various different processes myself I have come to the conclusion that some of the strategies mentioned below can help in persistance of motivation in a long term personal project without any unnatural self-enforced adherence.

Instead of deciding every morning whether or not to force themselves to exercise, they set up regular appointments to work out with a friend. Instead of counting on willpower to remain robust all day, they conserve it so that it‚Äôs available for emergencies and important decisions‚Ä¶.‚ÄôEven the wisest people won‚Äôt make good choices when they‚Äôre not rested and their glucose is low,‚Äô Baumeister points out. That‚Äôs why the truly wise don‚Äôt restructure the company at 4 p.m. They don‚Äôt make major commitments during the cocktail hour. And if a decision must be made late in the day, they know not to do it on an empty stomach. ‚ÄòThe best decision makers,‚Äô Baumeister says, ‚Äòare the ones who know when not to trust themselves.‚Äô‚Ä¶Conversation with [[Gwern Branwen::https://twitter.com/gwern]]. (2019-Dec-19). Email Exchange  ‚Ä¶'I bounce between projects to maintain my interest. (In Kurzban's theory, willpower seems to reflect opportunity cost and a built-in aversion to overcomitting to a task which hasn't delivered any large rewards yet, and switching regularly helps prevent burnout.) Since many of my pages are incremental, there's always little things to be done'‚Ä¶Conversation with [[Prathyush Pramod::https://twitter.com/prathyvsh]]. (2019-Nov-15th). Twitter Exchange  ‚Ä¶'Having no set goal in mind means you are not worried about completing anything. Also lately, I‚Äôm finding things are more interconnected than they seem. So whatever I learn contributes to a the whole than narrowing down to a slice of it'‚Ä¶Taleb, Nicholas Nassim. (2015). AntifragileTaleb, Nicholas Nassim. (2018). [[Twitter thread on routine::https://twitter.com/nntaleb/status/1029812693660848129]]  Routine is effortless. Most humans, alas, prefer to expend physical, never intellectual energy. Creating requires much, much more effort.Graham, Paul. (2013). [[Do Things That Don't Scale::http://paulgraham.com/ds.html]]My Journal Entry, Jan 6th 2019  Clearly, my brain has learned to ignore the Google calendar notifications. Initially, scheduling and completely the event/task used to feel rewarding, so I built up on that and kept adding trivial items in my calendar like gym, writing, journaling, etc. Although it worked for a couple of days, somehow there was a behavioral shift in how I was responding to the notifications, now it was not only the trivial ones that I was ignoring, the important ones too got side-tracked as a result of decision fatigue.  Although the extremely important ones had this aging process of incremental prioritization owing to [[Parkinson's Law::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law]].
