- when plan to run sample project of other developer specially in github, in order to run their project, you need an apple developer
account or even free icloud account. free icloud account accomodates maximum of 5 apps existing in your device. For example, you have already 5 sample projects running in your iphone using your free icloud account, if you make another sample apps to be install in your iphone then the xcode will throw an error indicates that you need to delete some of sample projects.
