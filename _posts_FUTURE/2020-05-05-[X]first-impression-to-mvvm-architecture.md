This is I coded way back year 2017,

See? it can be called as a **God File** since all business logic were here. Coded from one file that exceeds 1k lines as student will feel a **sense of pride**, but in reality, It's just a trap way back before that I actually created a ðŸ”¥**Massive View Controller**. Think about looking a bug that coded for a years. To be able to point out where to change or needed to adjust, we need to scroll from top to bottom with 2k+ line of codes looking for affected parts and its dependency. *Oh sh^t are you serious?!

this is one of disadvantage of not knowing about **Software Architectural Pattern**.

Then why does Separation of Concern stands out? What are the benefits of implement this kind of chuchu? For first Impression, i'm sure
our mind project that its too complicated when hearing about this, but in reality its just a concept that recreated for more than a year that shipped not just one language, but others as well, that are capable to integrate it in order to achieve segregation of concern, getting the files who does the business logic and do a Unit test there, and other stuffs.




In the end, for me, learning the MVC Pattern is a must specially in School because they will realize later on the Architectural Pattern if they decided to jump on it.


**WIP**
